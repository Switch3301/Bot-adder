# Title
Discord Bot-Adding Script

# Description
This Python script allows you to add bots to Discord servers with ease.

# Instructions:
- Open the config.json file and replace the value of client_id with your bot's developer ID.
- Select the desired permission level by assigning an integer value to the permission field:
   -> 8 for admin
   -> 0 for adding without permissions (commonly used)
- Enter your user token in the token field. Make sure that the token belongs to a user that is already a member of the servers and has the appropriate permissions to add a bot.
- Obtain your Capsolver key from https://capsolver.com and replace the value of the capsolverkey field.
- Add the IDs of the desired servers to the guilds.txt file, one per line.
- Run the script.
